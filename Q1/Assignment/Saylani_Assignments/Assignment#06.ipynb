        "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model in which programs are organized around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. Examples of an object can range from physical entities, such as a human being that is described by properties like name and address, down to small computer programs, such as widgets. This opposes the historical approach to programming where emphasis was placed on how the logic was written rather than how to define the data within the logic."
